<h3>How It Works</h3>

<p>“It’s Chinese To Me” is a pictorial translator for Chinese language blogs. Using a computer program to break down each blog post into its constituent words, it then inputs each word into the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/" target="_new">Flickr</a> image search engine. The “most relevant” search result returned for each word becomes that term’s pictorial “translation.” This search process is repeated once every 24 hours, so that the translations are continually updated as more “relevant” images become available online.</p>
